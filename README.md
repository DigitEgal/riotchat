# Riot Chat for Nextcloud

Riot Chat for Nextcloud allows you to install Riot easily through Nextcloud and join the Matrix decentralized communication network.

This app does not include a Matrix server, only the client. You will have to either set up your own Matrix homeserver, rent one, or use a public one.
